# neboc prelude-report

Inspect the exact implicit prelude declarations.

```text
Identity: cli:prelude-report (CLI_FORM)
Edition: 1
Target: x86_64-systemv-elf-linux
Availability: EDITION_1_BOUNDED
```

## Syntax or signature

```text
neboc prelude-report [--edition 1]
```

## Behavior and usage

Reports eleven current declarations with their original module, PRELUDE origin, serialized SymbolId, target and interface digest. This is metadata, not source execution.

## Exit codes and remediation

Exit 0 means this command completed its stated operation; source errors use 1, invalid usage or environment uses 2, and an internal failure uses 101. An emitted file is not runtime proof. Correct the diagnostic and retry; never execute a rejected or partially published artifact.

## Example commands

neboc prelude-report --edition 1

## Execution boundary

This entry defines syntax, metadata or a restricted profile. It does not introduce a callable constructor. The observations below verify its stated boundary; no source execution is inferred from a catalog entry.

## Negative example applicability

No distinct source trigger is asserted for this definition. The associated native/CLI boundary tests below are supplementary evidence, not a fabricated source rejection.

## Additional observations and limits
