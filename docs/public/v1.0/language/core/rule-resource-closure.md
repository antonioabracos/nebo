# resource closure

Private filesystem operations enforce beneath/no-symlink paths and close resources. Native synchronization semantics are a separate internal supplement and do not grant additional stable source APIs.

Identity: N1-resource-closure (NORMATIVE_RULE)
Edition: 1
Target: x86_64-systemv-elf-linux
Availability: NORMATIVE_BOUNDARY_WITH_INTERNAL_SUPPLEMENT

## Syntax or signature

```text
N1-resource-closure — NORMATIVE_BOUNDARY_WITH_INTERNAL_SUPPLEMENT
```

## Scope and constraints

Private filesystem operations enforce beneath/no-symlink paths and close resources. Native synchronization semantics are a separate internal supplement and do not grant additional stable source APIs.

## Use and remediation

Follow the admitted forms in the individual syntax and operator references. Keep source order and type identity; make imports and capability grants explicit. A native supplemental contract does not introduce source constructors or widen target support.

## Execution boundary

This entry defines syntax, metadata or a restricted profile. It does not introduce a callable constructor. The observations below verify its stated boundary; no source execution is inferred from a catalog entry.

## Negative example applicability

No distinct source trigger is asserted for this definition. The associated native/CLI boundary tests below are supplementary evidence, not a fabricated source rejection.
