# public-scientific — filled

Actual Bool/Int64/binary64 operands and native rank/shape/stride/root descriptors; Bool storage is packed bytes; CPU rank 0..6 and 4096 elements; Int construction/arithmetic retains C12 rank 0..3, dimensions 0..8 and 64 elements; index tensors from argMax retain full result geometry. Shape inputs are constant Int Tuples or material Int Vectors. fromBuffer copies exact typed Int/Float Vector, live Int Slice or checked 0/1 Bytes for Bool. Float selection uses equal shapes or explicit broadcastTo; map uses a typed noncapturing Float function and preserves ordered effects. Float reductions reject empty/nonfinite inputs and invalid axes; first argMax tie. Structural methods compose native owners; peers are 1..6 immutable Tensor names in a Tuple, split takes 1..6 exact sizes, padding has two entries per axis. Readonly function borrows and caller-owned result copies preserve lifetimes. Every cited oracle executes real source, including negatives and bounded-domain failures.

## Availability and maturity

EXPERIMENTAL; evidence FROZEN_PUBLIC_SOURCE. Documentation does not promote this identity to stable. Public and owner namespaces are separate contracts.

## Privacy, dependencies and authority

Capability: NONE. Gate: NONE. Import grants capability: NO. Use synthetic local data. Hardware claim: NO. Security assurance: NO. RELEASE-LEGAL_PENDING_SEPARATE_FROM_CORE_FUNCTIONAL_PROFILE. SDK buffers and handles follow the owner lifecycle and reject invalid/released inputs where specified. No downloaded models, secrets, external network or device access is needed for the documented local proofs.
